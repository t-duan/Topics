    "# Topics – Easy Topic Modeling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The text mining technique **Topic Modeling** has become a popular statistical method for clustering documents. This [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) introduces a step-by-step workflow, basically containing data preprocessing, the actual topic modeling using **latent Dirichlet allocation** (LDA), which learns the relationships between words, topics, and documents, as well as some interactive visualizations to explore the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA, introduced in the context of text analysis in [2003](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf), is an instance of a more general class of models called **mixed-membership models**. Involving a number of distributions and parameters, the topic model is typically performed using [Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) with conjugate priors and is purely based on word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been written numerous introductions to topic modeling for humanists (e.g. [this one](http://scottbot.net/topic-modeling-for-humanists-a-guided-tour/)), which provide another level of detail regarding its technical and epistemic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workflow, you will need a corpus (a set of texts) as plain text (`.txt`) or [TEI XML](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) (`.xml`). Using the `dariah_topics` package, you also have the ability to process the output of [DARIAH-DKPro-Wrapper](https://github.com/DARIAH-DE/DARIAH-DKPro-Wrapper), a command-line tool for *natural language processing*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling works best with very large corpora. The [TextGrid Repository](https://textgridrep.org/) is a great place to start searching for text data. Anyway, to demonstrate the technique, we provide one small text collection in the folder `grenzboten_sample` containing 15 diary excerpts, as well as 15 war diary excerpts, which appeared in *Die Grenzboten*, a German newspaper of the late 19th and early 20th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Of course, you can work with your own corpus in this notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're relying on the LDA implementation by [Allen B. Riddell](https://www.ariddell.org/), called [lda](http://pythonhosted.org/lda/index.html), which is very lightweight. Aside from that, we provide two more Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [IntroducingMallet](IntroducingMallet.ipynb), using LDA by [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php), which is known to be very robust. \n",
    "* [IntroducingGensim](IntroducingGensim.ipynb), using LDA by called [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/project/gensim/), which is attractive because of its multi-core support.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information in general, have a look at the [documentation](http://dev.digital-humanities.de/ci/job/DARIAH-Topics/doclinks/1/)."

    "## First step: Installing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To work within this Jupyter notebook, you will have to import the `dariah_topics` library. As you do, `dariah_topics` also imports a couple of external libraries, which have to be installed first. `pip` is the preferred installer program in Python. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers. If you are interested in `pip`, have a look at [this website](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the `dariah_topics` library with all dependencies, open your commandline, go with `cd` to the folder `Topics` and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get any errors or are not able to install *all* dependencies properly, try [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pip) for troubleshooting or create a new issue on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/DARIAH-DE/Topics).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: If you are on macOS or Linux, you will have to use `pip3` and `python3`."

    "As you probably already know, code has to be written in the grey cells. You execute a cell by clicking the **Run**-button (or **Ctrl + Enter**). If you want to run all cells of the notebook at once, click **Cell > Run All** or **Kernel > Restart & Run All** respectively, if you want to restart the Python kernel first. On the left side of an (unexecuted) cell stands `In [ ]:`. The empty bracket means, that the cell hasn't been executed yet. By clicking **Run**, a star appears in the brackets (`In [*]:`), which means the process is running. In most cases, you won't see that star, because your computer is faster than your eyes. You can execute only one cell at once, all following executions will be in the waiting line. If the process of a cell is done, a number appears in the brackets (`In [1]:`)."
